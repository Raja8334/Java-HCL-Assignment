## Why CssSelector Faster than xpath ? and Why xpath slower ?

CSS Selectors are faster because they are natively supported by all browsers and use the browser’s internal rendering engine for matching elements. This makes CSS selection lightweight and extremely optimized.
CSS = less traversal + less complexity.

XPath is slower because it needs an additional engine to parse and evaluate complex expressions. XPath traversal is more computationally expensive since it allows parent, sibling, and two-directional DOM navigation, which increases processing time.
