* TestNG supports a @DataProvider for using same testcase with multiple data.
* TestNG have a Priority case
*TestNG supports parallel execution of tests (methods, classes, or suites) through testng.xml, which helps reduce execution time.
* TestNG allows test methods to depend on other methods or groups using dependsOnMethods and dependsOnGroups.
* TestNG supports parameter passing through testng.xml using @Parameters, which is very useful for cross-browser testing.
* TestNG generates detailed HTML reports by default, showing passed, failed, and skipped test cases.
* TestNG uses testng.xml to configure test suites, control execution order, groups, parameters, and parallelism.
